## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🎓 **Training System**
- Tracks **skill points** across multiple training areas.
- Users complete **challenges** to gain experience and level up.
- Global progress meters determine overall **survival readiness**.
- Supports **real-time updates & persistent state saving** with LocalStorage.  

### 🎭 **Survival Scenario Simulator**
- Interactive scenarios with **dynamic challenges**.
- **Time-based survival mechanics** (e.g., complete objectives before time runs out).
- **Only one active scenario runs at a time**.
- Supports **starting, pausing, and completing challenges** dynamically.

### 🆘 **Emergency Preparedness Checklist**
- Covers **shelter, food, finances, transportation, and personal security**.
- **Responsive UI** optimized for small phones (320px+), tablets, and desktops.
- **Touch-friendly controls** with large tap targets (44x44px minimum) for mobile usability.
- **Accessible design** with ARIA attributes, clear focus states, and screen reader support.
- Readiness level indicators from **Unprepared 🚨 to Ultimate Survivalist 🏆**.
- **LocalStorage integration** saves checklist states across sessions.
- **Export options**: Save as JSON or PDF for sharing or printing.

### **🛠️ Survival Tools**
Enhance your survival experience with built-in survival tools, including:  

- **Signal Mirror** – Flashes an SOS light pattern to simulate emergency signaling.
- **Compass** – Uses device orientation to provide a real-time directional heading.
- **Pedometer** – Tracks step count using motion sensors.
- **Morse Code Translator** – Converts text into Morse code and plays it via vibrations.
- **Level Tool** – Uses accelerometer data to determine balance and leveling.

### ✅ **Survival Guides Library**
- Organized by **categories** (e.g., Fire-Making, Shelter, Water Collection, Foraging, Tactical, etc.).
- Each guide includes **step-by-step instructions, required materials, and tips**.
- **Readiness meters** track completion levels for individual guides and overall preparedness.
- **Markdown rendering** converts guides into a structured HTML format.

### 🔄 **LocalStorage Integration**
- **Saves key user progress** (guides, checklist, training progress) across sessions.
- Uses **individual keys** for optimized storage (`emergencyCategories`, `trainingProgress`, `libraryGuides`, etc.).
- Ensures efficient data retrieval and updates without unnecessary UI re-rendering.
